## Welcome to My Page

I am mechanical engineering distinguished by fulfilling projects of web development using agile methodologies - Scrum.

I achieve my objectives thanks to my commitment, use of the knowledge acquired from engineering, ability to visualize projects and the search for continuous improvement through new technologies. I never stop learning.

I'm on LinkedIn to search for career opportunities and connect with professionals with ambitions equal to or greater than mine.
